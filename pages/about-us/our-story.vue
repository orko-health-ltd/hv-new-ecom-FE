        But the story behind is not as nice as Halda Valley appears now. When iconic business personality and philanthropist Md. Nader Khan acquired this estate in 2003, nothing but wild bushes and rain forests were only remains. He had to start from the scratch with zero experience in tea industry. With the love of nature and passion to make a difference in tea industry of Bangladesh, He devoted all his passion and talent to create a masterpiece out of nothing. Now within only 17 years of inception, Halda Valley is the fastest growing, highest yielding and most prosperous tea estate in this country.
